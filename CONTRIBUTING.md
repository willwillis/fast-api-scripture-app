## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

We maintain consistent code style across the project:

#### Backend (Python)
- **Formatting**: Black with line length 88
- **Import sorting**: isort with black profile
- **Linting**: flake8 with max line length 88
- **Type hints**: Required for all public functions
- **Docstrings**: Google style for modules and classes

```python
# Good example
def search_scriptures(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[ScriptureResult]:
    """Search scriptures by text query.

    Args:
        query: The search term to look for
        limit: Maximum number of results to return

    Returns:
        List of scripture results matching the query
    """
```

#### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
- **Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- **Types**: Explicit TypeScript types for all props and functions
- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes

```typescript
// Good example
interface ScriptureSearchProps {
  query: string;
  onResultsChange: (results: ScriptureResult[]) => void;
}

export const ScriptureSearch: React.FC<ScriptureSearchProps> = ({
  query,
  onResultsChange,
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear, semantic commit messages:

```

[optional footer]
```

#### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without functionality changes
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `chore`: Build, tooling, or dependency updates

#### Examples
