# Overview 
I want to create a scripture reading web application application
I want the style to be dark background with soft muted hilights, similar to the cursor code editing UI

# Backend
FastAPI using sqlite database stored in ./submodules/sqlite/lds-scriptures-sqlite.db there is a schema.txt and README  and other files describing the data structure in that folder


# Frontend
Vite + React 
I want the front-end to be mobile first and responsive for desktop clients.
The mobile interface should be intuitive and very small hacker like text.
Before starting the project suggest to me what CSS library or framework I might want to use to accomplish this.

# Code Organization
I want to have the front-end code separated from the back-end fast api code
suggest a folder structure and naming convention to accomplish this.

# Further Direction
- I'll be using uv, not pip for this project
- Addd the appropriate patterns to my .gitignore for React and Python projects
- I did some [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/pages/znF1zmBzX5tBsby1ULrip) research on git submodules before starting the cursor part of this project
